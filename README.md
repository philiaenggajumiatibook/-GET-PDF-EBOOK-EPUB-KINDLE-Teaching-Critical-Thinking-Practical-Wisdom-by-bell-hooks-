Review: Encouraging discussion for critical thinking as well as many other insights makes this book a must. It's not a list of "do this, not that"--it's more of a "challenge your previous ways of thinking" approach which I think is excellent (if you're going to teach critical thinking, start with yourself!).

Review: Teaching Critical Thinking: Practical Wisdom (2010) is the third installment of bell hooks's Teaching Trilogy and is preceded by Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope (2003) and Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom (1994). hooks, a celebrated feminist cultural critic, critical race scholar, and educator addresses her critics and admirers alike in her most recent collection. While certainly a marked departure from canonical higher education and student affairs texts on pedagogy, learning, and critical thinking, hooks's anthology elucidates many issues regarding engaging students both in and outside of the classroom. Importantly, hooks provides another voice (albeit inadvertently) underscoring why student affairs educators are needed in higher education: educators in the field directly contribute to efforts of advancing critical thinking that hooks details. As she notes in her introduction, hooks was "excited to write these short commentaries; there are so many worthwhile issues surrounding teaching that are worth considering" (p. 5). Student affairs educators reading this work will connect to many of the issues hooks discusses.In Teaching Critical Thinking, hooks delineates 32 separate commentaries, which she titles "teachings", ranging from teaching and engaging styles to feminist epistemological stances on education to identity politics. Among the texts within the mainstream student affairs and higher education canon (e.g., Baxter Magolda, 2001, 2009; Evans, Forney, Guido, Patton, & Renn, 2010; Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, & Norman, 2010), hooks's work is a clear outlier. Its style is a unique combination of prose and reflective autobiography. While classic works common among student affairs educators' professional libraries provide the reader with a robust literature reviews, theoretical frameworks, and case study methodologies, hooks's personalized account will provide the reader with an alternate lens through which to contemplate the role of teaching, meaning making, and one's identity as an educator. Expanding one's professional library to include divergent voices is akin to assisting students in considering multiple perspectives and positions. Teaching Critical Thinking, especially when read sequentially in the Teaching Trilogy, is an excellent access point for student affairs educators.Several teachings are especially relevant for the student affairs educator audience. In teaching 1, hooks discusses her thoughts on critical thinking, asserting that the act of thinking requires collaborative efforts from students and educators alike. She writes, "[w]hen everyone . . . recognizes that they are responsible for creating a learning community . . . learning is at its most meaningful" (2010, p. 11). Teachings 9 and 10 underscore the importance of storytelling and story sharing; she argues that what makes the individual unique is often dismissed within the academy. Indeed, student affair educators are well positioned to engage students in meaningful conversations about identity, history, and purpose; hooks underscores the importance of this practice with conviction. Teaching 18, "Learning Past the Hate" creates a much-needed space for educators wherein they address hatred and misunderstanding and, importantly, grow and heal from it. She vies that educators are trained to silence those who agitate the learning community, which stymies the growth of the student and does nothing to address the psychological pain the educator and other students experience. In teaching 21, hooks boldly addresses self-esteem, something that she feels is lacking amongst students and educators alike. hooks contends that a "primary problem with self-esteem [in the educational setting] is that a great majority of teachers lack this very crucial character trait" (2010, p. 123). Student affairs educators who choose to engage with the text will undoubtedly see linkages among hooks's experiences, her thoughts on academic instruction and critical thinking, and one's personal experiences within the student affairs profession.While hooks's passion and commitments are infused throughout the anthology, a reader new to hooks altogether might be jarred: both her style and structure are marked departure from most educational texts common to the profession. Moreover, readers who have previously accessed hooks's works (either through her first two Teaching Trilogy texts or earlier writings on racism and sexism) might find this final text in the trilogy unsatisfying or muddled. Despite hooks's comments explaining her stylistic choices, Teaching Critical Thinking, reads as a somewhat insufficient end to what is otherwise a monumental contribution to critical examinations on education. The eponymous teaching 1 does not give critical thinking as an outcome due justice. Moreover, hooks does not provide continuity in how the other 31 teachings relate, explicate, or problematize critical thinking and the role an educator ought to play. Still, while hooks's wisdom, insight, and practicality are somewhat overshadowed by the text's circuitous structuring, the independent content is still meaningful and needed. Of note is hooks's titling of each teaching: they are intuitively named and allow the reader to quickly scan the contents for meaningful and pertinent passages (e.g., Teaching 28, Feminist Change, examines the roles feminism plays in shaping teaching and learning).Despite some of the its organizational limitations, Teaching Critical Thinking has an immense amount to offer to those who work directly with students and for those whose research agenda includes student learning, pedagogy, and student development. Student affairs educators ought to first read the preceding installments - Teaching to Transgress (1994) and Teaching Community (2003). Doing so will provide the reader with a helpful framework for understanding her literary style and her philosophical beliefs regarding education. Notwithstanding this potential learning curve, Teaching Critical Thinking is an important, poignant, and emotionally powerful contribution to our collective understanding about what it means to be an educator, and how to facilitate and sustain critical thinking. Her body of work conveys a confluence of conviction, intelligence, and passion notably lacking in standard fare student affairs texts. As a public intellectual, hooks writes in a fashion that is as accessible as it is highly intellectual. Best read in sequence, Teaching Critical Thinking is a welcomed and direly needed addition to student affairs scholarship.References:Ambrose, S. A., Bridges, M. W., DiPietro, M., Lovett, M.

Title: EducationCriticalThinkingandFreedom
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2011
Review: bell is a profound and provocative thinker. She causes us to think about what education can accomplish. Her cornerstone is that of critical thinking, a concept that is not taught often enough or from a child's early years. She clearly demonstrates the value of critical thinking in every person's life, not just those who are intellectual or academic. Peace, freedom, and democracy rest on the idea of critical thinking. To excel and feel alive and free we must all learn to think critically. Clearly the masses do not know how to think critically, for they were never taught how and they don't recognize the value in it. bell hooks is passionate about her teaching and it this comes through so very loud and clear in the way she writes. Every educator should read this book. Every student should read this book. It addresses democracy, social change, feminism, critical thinking, racism, and freedom. Her book is a true pleasure to read.
